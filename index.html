  <p class="text-muted">Every school has a library and like every school, even my school has a wonderful library. A library is a very important part of a school as it helps students to gain and acquire knowledge.

    It is the heart and soul of a school as it provides lots of information and details that students would require.Our school has a very large library. There are plenty number of books in the library. We have a librarian who keeps a track of all the books that go in and out of the library. We have an exclusive library period, where we are allowed to go and read books.

    From small story books to large reference books, journals and magazines are all available in our library. They are all arranged in different sections, so that it becomes easy for those who search for a particular book. It helps students refer notes that they are looking for and helps in cultivating a reading habit too.</p>

  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>School Auditorium</kbd></h4>

  <hr>
  <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize"> Was built in 1982</h5>

  <p class="text-muted">High School auditorium has spent more than six decades being host to countless school and community drama productions (and rehearsals), musical performances for all five schools, districtwide talent shows, assemblies, opening day celebrations, meetings, community events and programs, award and induction ceremonies…and the list goes on and on.

    The auditorium, in its heyday, was grand. But 63 years of wear and tear (with very few upgrades over the years) has left it in need of considerable upgrades and improvements.</p>

  <h4>New School Canteen</h4>

Our school canteen have an important role in the provision of food to students and the school community as
 well as being an integral part of the school environment. The school canteen should reflect the educational
  goals of the school and support and complement student learning.Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths.
   Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray. In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting. Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table. For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at the check-out, and fill the container after the check-out. Free unlimited second servings are often allowed under this system. For legal purposes (and the consumption patterns of customers), this system is rarely, if at all, used for alcoholic drinks in the United States.
  Customers are either charged a flat rate for admission (as in a buffet) or pay at the check-out for each item.
  Some self-service cafeterias charge by the weight of items on a patron's plate. In universities and colleges,
   some students pay for three meals a day by making a single large payment for the entire semester.
  As cafeterias require few employees, they are often found within a larger institution,
   catering to the clientele of that institution.</p>

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
<img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
<p class="list-group-items col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">

Using our new Online Attendance Management System allows 3 things:
              
 1. Monitoring the exact arrival time of each student and automatically alert parents in case of a student's absence. 
 Also, teachers can record the attendance at their class,
  report the causes of absence and inform the parents about their child's absences via SMS and email.

  2.It enables a school to record, report and student attendance and absence.
   Registers can be set for classes,
    grades and school trips.

  3.In our student attendance management systems,
   the students’ attendance is stored in the form of digital data.
    This data is highly secured as this software is protected with multiple layers of security.
     To login into the software,
      users need to enter their assigned user ID followed by their passwords.
       Unauthorized users can’t have access to this software.
        Only school management, teachers, and parents have such access,
         which they can do anytime and from anywhere.
          All they need is a mobile, laptop or a computer with internet connectivity.
           Parents can now easily track their ward’s attendance.
            A student attendance management system also helps in automatically generating any kind of attendance report.
